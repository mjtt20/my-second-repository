    <p>Kuthibari in Kumarkhali is one of the top tourist attractions from Kushtia district. You could visit the place during any time of the year. But it would be best to visit during the 25th Baishakh of Bangla calendar (8th of May). That particular day is the birthday of the poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, and the local authority arranges a large village fair there. It is one of the largest village fairs in Bangladesh. Read more about it from <a href="https://www.alonelytraveler.com/shilaidaha-kuthibari-kushtia/">Shelaidaha Kuthi Bari</a>.</p>
